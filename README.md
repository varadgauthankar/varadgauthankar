## Hi there 👋, I am Varad Gauthankar.

Hello everyone,

For many years, I was deeply passionate about coding. I wrote code, built apps, and thrived in the tech world. But about a year ago, something changed. Coding, once a source of joy and inspiration, began to feel like a chore. My enthusiasm waned, and it became clear that I needed a change.

I dared to follow my heart and pursue a long-held passion: art. 🖌️ While art had always been a personal love, I never envisioned it as my future. However, life has a way of surprising us.

Today, I find myself immersed in the world of art, studying at an art college, and experiencing a level of fulfillment I hadn't imagined. Every stroke of the brush, every creation, is a journey of self-discovery and joy. I'm truly savoring life and art to the fullest.

But here's the exciting part—I remain enthusiastic about the technology world! While my career path has shifted, my curiosity and interest in technology continue to thrive. I'm still closely following tech developments, and I believe that my newfound perspective as an artist will bring fresh insights into the intersection of art and technology.

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who supported me during my coding days and made them special. The skills and experiences from that chapter are invaluable and continue to shape who I am.

To fellow artists, creators, and dreamers, I extend a warm invitation to connect. Let's inspire one another and share the beauty of our creative journeys. 🤝

Thank you for being part of my story. Whether you've been with me through coding or are joining me on this artistic adventure, I'm excited to connect and share experiences.

Wishing you all success and fulfillment in your own pursuits!🌟

Warm regards,
Varad
